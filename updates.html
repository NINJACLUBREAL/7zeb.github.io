   <h1>Here are the updates from 7Zeb, listed from newest to oldest.</h1>
   <br>
   <h3>April 17, 2025 11:33 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Today is the livestream about Ubuntu 25.04, I have the ISO downloaded already, and also Betavault Beta has the link too, the livestream will probably start at 4:00 PM CDT (9:00 PM UTC), so that's going to be cool.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 13, 2025 7:30 PM CDT</h3>
   <p>Ok, ok so today was a terrible day, I wasted my time, but now at 7:30 PM, I present to you, one of the hardest challanges I might have to do (ok that's clearly a lie because I have STAAR tests in like 2 days), but this is still a big challange, what is it you might ask? well, I'm adding Project NewUI to a bunch of pages, and also I've realized that I have a bunch of useless pages, for these I'll reuse them or delete them, so yeah. Also I know everyone just wants me to go back to the goold old days where I was just talking about my videos, and Windows, so I'll add a bit of that too, for videos, I'm STILL working on the Unboxing a Headset video, because I can't edit when I get distracted with stupid ideas like adding NewUI, and I also have a TON and I mean a TON of videos that are unedited, looks like I better hurry up and edit instead of coding on Github all day. For the Windows things, I have finished the Windows Vista Upgrade Saga (now I just have to edit) and I also recorded a Windows Vista Starter video which I want to edit too, wow a lot of stuff in this update.</p>
   <h3>April 10, 2025 11:17 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>So now Betavault has some Ubuntu versions to download (not all of them), but some of them, I'm going to add more today, I'm also hoping on adding some Xbuntu versions today, for the videos side of things I have a couple of things, first of all, I'm going to be going live on April 17, 2025 (hopefully) to check out Ubuntu 25.04, which will be out on that day. The 2nd thing is that I'm currently editing the Unboxing the headset video, and hopefully will start editing the Multibooting Windows Vista video soon.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 9, 2025 11:31 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Ok, so I made a new Updates page that has all the old updates, but the new UI, most of the pages are going to stay the same but just have thew New UI, find more about the New UI on the 7Zeb Wiki, which is in the github repo.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 5, 2025 10:24 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Well we have a ton of stuff going on, so let me explain all of it, starting off with the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga, yestrday we beat our goal of installing 2 builds a day and installed 3 builds in a day, this is a huge improvment as now we are far ahead, another thing is we got progress done in the Windows Vista Multibooting video, so it's great to see that, today I'm planning on getting 2 builds on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga, and I'm planning to finish recording the Multibooting Windows Vista video.</p>  
   <br>
   <h3>April 3, 2025 8:33 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>The CSS has been migrated to index.html and updates.html, so that's good.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 2, 2025 7:31PM CDT (because we're in DST now)</h3>
   <p>Well the updates page is now on Github pages, YES!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 26, 2025 10:20AM CST</h3>
   <p>The next 2 videos on my channel are done, and also WE HAVE NEW BRANDING AGAIN!!! 2 branding changes in a month is insane, also look out for the Minor Upload Boom which will start on March 7!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 21, 2025 1:07PM CST</h3>
   <p>Today's video has been delayed by 30 minutes because I didn't finish editing :), I'm going to start editing at 4PM (hopefully), so hopefully the video will come out today at 4:30PM, if I don't feel like editing today, I'll livestream me trying to install Windows Longhorn Build 4011.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 14, 2025 4:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>For those of you wondering where the Multibooting video went, it has been delayed until today at 5:00PM CST, the reason why is because well this time is trash.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 11, 2025 9:54AM CST</h3>
   <p>So the video finished exporting, the file size is 2.7GB (for some reason in Clipchamp it showed 2.9 GB) anyways now it's being uploaded to YouTube and it's currently 1% done uploading (this will take a while won't it), I'll keep y'all updated.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 10, 2025 1:22PM CST</h3>
   <p>Ok, so the video is done and it's exporting and it's currently at 5% so it's taking a while, hopefully it can finish exporting quickly.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 10, 2025 12:18PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well well well, I am 97% done editing the multibooting video, I'm currently adding the background music for the video, also the thumbnail is almost done and you'll see it on the Premire page for the video. The video will come out on the 13th hopefully, so let's hope that my video editor doesn't break, and that I can add all the background music, and export the video today. I also want to get the premire set up today but I can't unless the video is done.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 9, 2025 1:14PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well, we have the first teaser post on the updates page of this website, so I'm going to put an image of how the editing for the multibooting video is going. So I hope you enjoy this, looking forward to this epic video coming out soon🔥</p>
  <a href='https://postimg.cc/MfxFHVzz' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/kGt3jvZR/Screenshot-2025-02-09-1-12-08-PM.png' border='0' alt='Screenshot-2025-02-09-1-12-08-PM'/></a>
   <br>
   <h3>February 9, 2025 9:35AM CST</h3>
   <p>We have some very big news, I decided to restore the website back to normal because I'm most likely (97% sure) returning on February 13 - 15, 2025, my next video will be the multibooting video and I will post some more updates about the video soon. Until then, you can see my website. My channel name will be changed back to 7Zeb after YouTube let's me (because it says I have to wait 12 days before I can change my channel name) so goodbye for now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 8, 2025 11:14AM CST</h3>
   <p>Big News about the Minor Upload Boom that's supposed to take place from March 7 - 16. I am currently trying to decide if I should cancel the Minor Upload Boom, or if I should keep it. Right now, I don't know what videos would even be in there. Also some news regarding this (which I am now calling the 7Zeb Break) is that the multibooting video will still be the first one done. I'm sorry that I can't make community posts or respond to comments right now because YouTube Studio is kind of broken, so I can't do any of that. New Updates should be out in a couple of hours or tomorrow</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 8, 2025 8:49AM CST</h3>
   <p>Welcome back, we have more updates, and some good news (that i'm pretty sure you'll like). I finally can tell you why I was taking a break from YouTube, and I also have news about when I'm coming back (it's earlier than I thought). Ok, let's start with the first thing which is that my internet is terrible, Downloading a 1GB File from the Internet Archive takes 2 hours (most of that has to do with IA taking forever), another thing was school, exams are going to start soon, so this creates a huge problem. However I'm happy to annouce that the day I'm returning to YouTube will be on February 13-15 (one of those days) so much earlier than I thought. (the reason I thought it was May 22, is because I first wanted to wait until school ended, however that's a bad idea, and I didn't want to come back to YouTube in August because that's way too long, and school would start again so what's the point).</p>
     <br>
     <p>Now you might have a couple of questions, the first one is probably: Why Can't you upload in the summer? and the answer to that is pretty simple, it's because during the summer, everyone is using the internet and things just get slow for some reason (the internet in my room is 2mb/s over ethernet). The 2nd question is why are you coming back so early, and to that I say I'm not trying to lose my advanced features from YouTube, because last year (2024) I quit YouTube from May - July, and I lost advanced features. So that's the update, the countdown timer has been updated, and hopefully the website will be back to normal by Monday (February 10), if I get really lucky, I'll could return today, but there's a 99% I won't come back today, so don't think that I will. Bye</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 7, 2025 6:59PM CST</h3>
   <p>I have now decided to quit YouTube temporarly, I might still be on Discord (i don't know), however the day I will return is either May 22, or March 7. I want you to assume it's May 22. Don't worry, I will still post updates regularly, and I plan on having the 500 Subscriber Speical (which is the Multibooting video) to premire on the day I return. I will also have a countdown timer to until I come back. Thanks for understanding, and thank you all for the amazing support.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 7, 2025 1:31PM CST</h3>
   <p>The website has been temporarly shut down, due to me might be quitting YouTube, you might be asking why, and I am not going to answer that currently, I might change my mind later. However for now, the Exploring Minecraft Snapshot 25w05a video (which will prmeire in 2 hours) will be my last video (if i dont change my mind.)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 4, 2025 1:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>The 7Zeb videos website has been updated to show new videos on it.</h3>
   <br>
   <h3>January 28, 2025 12:18PM CST</h3>
   <p>This is the first update thing I made on this website in 2025, I actually kind of forgot about this, but anyways I wanted to talk about there being a issue with the multibooting video (my 500 subscriber special which is where I try to multiboot every version of Windows 7), anyways what went wrong was that I accidently messed up all the partitions and have to remake the entire video, so yeah this will take much longer now, hopefully it should come out before March 2025. Another thing I want to mention is the Windows Vista Retrospective video that I am working on, hopefully I can get this done by January 30, 2025 which is when Windows Vista is 18.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>December 19, 2024 8:46AM CST</h3>
   <p>Well, my newest video got taken down so I'm exporting a new one that will come out today, anyways the Major Upload Boom starts tomorrow and the website is getting ready now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 11, 2024 9:18AM CST</h3>
   <p>Hello, sorry for not making a post on Friday (I forgot), anyways we made some videos, and I have to edit the Server 2003 video, which was going to come out yestrday, but I couldn't get it out by then, anyways we have new branding, a new profile picture made by Made in PowerPoint <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@madeinpowerpoint">Go subscribe to him</a>, a new channel banner and website update will be coming soon so stay tuned for that</p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 8, 2024 1:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well today's video is going to be Windows 7 Build 6936, and tomorrows video will probably be an install tutorial on Windows Server 2003, I'm also hoping to get though a bunch of builds on the Dell Inspiron 5566's upgrade saga, so hopefully that will happen, another post will be made today talking about some changes I will be doing to the channel.<p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 4, 2024 5:27PM CST (because it's CST now)</h3>
   <p>Hello, and I know last week saturday and sunday did not go as planned, but I do know one thing, Friday's video will be "Exploring Windows 7 Build 6936", another thing I want to say is that the Dell Inspiron 5566 is currently on Build 9821, and will be upgraded to Build 9833 hopefully by Friday (unless another build before 9833 get's leaked)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 29, 2024 1:31PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, the video for Thursday is already done, and the video for Friday is exporting, the videos for Satuarday and Sunday are planned to be the following: On November 2, 2024 the video is UhhSMP Files EP2, and on November 3, 2024 the video is Windows 10 Build 9796, more videos could come out on those days and the videos could change, but for now that's the plan. Another thing I would like to say for this update is the fact Windows 10 Build 9821 is still not installed on the Dell Inspiron 5566, I'm probably going to install it on Thursday.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 28, 2024 8:36AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, I have installed 1 build on the Dell for the upgrade saga so far (Windows 10 Build 9785), the reason I skipped 9780 is because there is no x86 build leaked currently, the next build I'm going to install will be Windows 10 Build 9821, which will be in the upgrade saga video, and will also have it's own video, also a video on Installing Windows 8.1 on the Dell Inspiron 5566 will be coming out on Thursday (I still have a lot to edit for it), so that's the news for right now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 25, 2024 8:48AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, today Windows XP is 23 Years Old, and I have a good video planned, let's just hope I can record and edit in the same, day, I also want to start working on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga today but don't know if I can, first I have to install Windows 8.1 (hopefully that can be it's own video)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 24, 2024 12:53PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, tomorrow Windows XP will be 23 Years Old, and of course I have a video planned, also on Saturday a video on Grass7 (which is a cool Windows 7 modification) will be released, so make sure you check that out, I'm also working on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga (I still have to install Windows 8.1)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 15, 2024 12:52PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, I just wanted to say that Friday's video is somehow already done and is currently rendering, I will just give you a hint on what it is, it's about Windows Whistler 2257.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 15, 2024 8:47AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello eveyrone, the website's HTML code is back, and the site is back to normal, so yeah hopefully the site does not get hacked again</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 24, 2024</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone, I have coded a game in p5.js, and it is hosted on this website, <a href="https://7zeb.neocities.org/games/orange-paint">Click Here</a> to try it out, it's very simple, and you'll get bored of it in 10 secconds.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 11, 2024 12:51PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, WE ARE BACK!!!, That's right, New Video is coming Friday (in fact I already have it done. Saturday's video is going to be worked on starting today or tomorrow, I also have some new updates on OS Concepts, BlueOS is almost done, I'm in the OOBE. So that's it for now, see you on Friday when the new video comes out.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 9, 2024 12:15PM CT</h3>
   <p>So, the reason only a video came out on Friday was because I'm working on a big video project called Windows XP Development History, and Windows Whistler Build 2202 was driving me crazy, I could not install it even though I copied the files from MS-DOS to the hard drive, and I set the date back to February 2000. So I was pretty mad at that, anyways hopefully a video comes out on Friday.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 5, 2024 7:49AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, on September 3, I found an old video I recorded in March 2024, so I started editing the video, I actually finished editing the video, and it will be out tomorrow (Friday), I'll give a hint to what it is. It has to do with Windows Vista Beta builds.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 4, 2024 10:12PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone, I want to let you know that I'm working on a very big video project called "The History of 64 Bit Windows" which will be covering how Windows got support for 64 Bit Systems, and how Intel messed up on Intel Itanium.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 27, 2024 6:01PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, a video called "Exploring Windows 8 Build 7878" was supposed to be completed on Sunday, August 25, 2024. However there was a slight issue, while I was recording the video, my ISO file just randomly disapeared, which of course meant that I had to download it again, so you might be asking "Well why is this even an issue, and why are you even making an update about this?", well if you know, my internet is very slow, and I can't use my main computer until Friday, so that means that I have to redownload the 3.2 GB ISO File, which with my bad internet, and the fact that the Internet Archive (where I downloaded Windows 8 Build 7878) is blocked on my other computer, so now I have to wait until Friday to download the ISO file.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 23, 2024 - 5:35PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone, some slight issues are making the 3 YouTube videos a bit delayed, hopefully they still come out today.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 21, 2024 - 7:33 PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, we are getting closer to Friday, which is the day, that 3 videos go out, yes 3 whole videos will go out, I might also do a video on this website, as I don't think anyone on my YouTube channel knows about this website, unless you found my YouTube channel on Neocities.
   <br>
   <h3>August 20, 2024 - 5:54 PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, I just want to let you know that I have regained accses to my Google Account, 2 new (hopefully 3 new) videos should be out by Friday, if not then there is something wrong with me, my phone, or my computer. I have a couple of reasons why I'm not uploading every few days.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>My Internet has gotten bad all of a sudden, I have solved this by installing a network extender in the room I record, edit, and upload videos in.</li>
   <li>School has started, which means that I have to focus on schoolwork instead of making YouTube videos, like I used to do during summer.</li>
   <li>I'm working on a big video project, so even when I do get free time to work on videos, I'm busy working on that. I'll give you a hint to what it is. It involves Windows 95 in it, as I have said in my Discord Server.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>I hope you understand that all of this will make uploads less frequent, however I'm still comminting to try and do weekly uploads, if there are no videos out that week, you will get a reason why on this webpage. Thanks, and I'll upload the next video on Friday.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 19, 2024 - 8:31 PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone I have some bad news, I'm locked out of my Google Account, and the only way that I can get it back is to use a code on my phone, however I have lost my phone, so until I find my phone, I guess there will be no videos, don't worry though, I will keep on editing videos so that when I do get my account back. I already have 2 ready</p>
