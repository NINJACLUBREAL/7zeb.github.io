    <p>Ok, so Maze Game, which is a game I've wanted to add, is split into 2 releases, 1 (v1.0), which just has the maze game, while (v2.0) has new features such as a timer, into, how to play, and more. I will have a blog page created for the entire DevLog for Version 2.0, as v1.0 is already done.</p>

    <p>Hi, I've made some improvements to this site, and also added a new game, so I'm going to explain everything new, first of all, I added the topnav to the site, so that's a huge win, and I also added a new game.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The new game is called Sun Game, you can increase or decrease the size of the sun, there is a weird glitch in it though, which is if you click on the increase size button, the sun will start turning white every time you click on it, of course this game was coded in p5.js, and the source code can be found in the Github.</p>
